  <p id="abs" class="tLine slideHook slide" style="padding:15px"><span class="w_background"></span>
  	This website is full of litter!  I'm not even going to take out unnecessary portions of
    twitter's bootstrap and honestly I don't even know why I still have the bootstrap.  If you take a close look, 
    or really just a look, you'll see a landfill of packed away CSS from abandoned ideas.  The HTML may
    have been run through a blender and the LESS hasn't even been compiled.  A little chunk of jQuery
    is lying around somewhere... why? I have better work to do, and this needs to be functional today.
